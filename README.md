<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# Purpose of the App

Atomic Addicts is our LAP 2 Project. This app is for tracking, managing and cultivating habits. In-built are five key habits for you to choose from: `Sleeping, Exercise, Water Intake, Smoking, Savings`

It has the following functionalioty for users:

- Users should be able to login
- Users should be able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the frequency at which they want to track the habit
- Users should be able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day
- Users should be able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see their most recent completion streak
